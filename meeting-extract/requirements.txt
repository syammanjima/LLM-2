# Meeting Notes Extractor Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the code**
   ```bash
   # Save the main Python code as 'meeting_notes_app.py'
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Get OpenAI API Key**
   - Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Create a new secret key
   - Copy the key (you'll enter it in the app)

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Streamlit app**
   ```bash
   streamlit run meeting_notes_app.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser**
   - The app will automatically open at `http://localhost:8501`
   - If not, manually navigate to that URL

3. **Configure API Key**
   - Enter your OpenAI API key in the sidebar
   - The key is not stored permanently for security

## Usage

1. **Upload Audio File**
   - Supported formats: MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, OGG
   - Maximum file size: 25MB (adjustable in settings)

2. **Process Audio**
   - Click "Process Audio" button
   - Wait for transcription and analysis to complete

3. **View Results**
   - Meeting summary with key details
   - Detailed notes organized by topic
   - Action items prioritized by importance
   - Full transcript available in expandable section

4. **Download Reports**
   - Download full report as text file
   - Download structured data as JSON

## Features

✅ **Audio Transcription** - Uses OpenAI Whisper API
✅ **AI Analysis** - Uses GPT-4 for structured extraction
✅ **Performance Metrics** - Shows processing times
✅ **Priority Management** - Color-coded action items
✅ **Multiple Downloads** - Text and JSON formats
✅ **Responsive UI** - Works on desktop and mobile
✅ **Real-time Progress** - Loading indicators during processing

## Cost Considerations

- **Whisper API**: ~$0.006 per minute of audio
- **GPT-4 API**: ~$0.03 per 1K tokens (varies by transcript length)
- **Example**: 30-minute meeting ≈ $0.50-$2.00 total cost

## Troubleshooting

**"Module not found" errors:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade streamlit openai
```

**API key issues:**
- Ensure your OpenAI account has credits
- Check API key is correctly entered
- Verify internet connection

**Large file uploads:**
- Compress audio files before uploading
- Use MP3 format for smaller file sizes
- Consider splitting very long meetings

**Poor transcription quality:**
- Ensure clear audio with minimal background noise
- Use a good quality microphone for recordings
- Consider noise reduction before uploading

## Deployment Options

**Local Development:**
- Run on your computer with `streamlit run meeting_notes_app.py`

**Streamlit Cloud:**
- Push code to GitHub
- Deploy for free at https://share.streamlit.io

**Docker Deployment:**
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8501
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "meeting_notes_app.py"]
```

## Security Notes

- API keys are entered per session (not stored)
- Audio files are processed temporarily and not saved
- Consider using environment variables for production API keys

## Customization

**Modify GPT prompt** in `extract_structured_data()` function
**Adjust UI styling** in the CSS section
**Add new features** like speaker identification or sentiment analysis
**Export formats** can be extended (PDF, Word, etc.)
